<!--
Insert unescape HTML content in a component.
This must not be used from data coming from a third party as it is
a high risk of XSS attack.

Example:

const textWithHtml = 'this is <strong>awesome</strong>!'
return `<p><safe-html>${textWithHtml}</safe-html></p>`
-->
<script>
  connected() {
    this.document.innerHTML = this.document.host.textContent
  }
</script>
